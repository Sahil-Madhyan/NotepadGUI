# About the App

We have created a notepad with different menus like file and edit. These menus will help us do things like save our work, open files, and cut and paste. To make this notepad, we need to install something called the tkinter module. We'll use this module to create pop-up messages and file dialogs. We'll also use something called the OS module to interact with our computer's operating system. This will help us create, remove, and move folders. We can even see what files are in a folder! Finally, we'll use some file operations like open, close, read, and write to edit our notepad files.
